# DatBase
This is going to be an explaination of what this is! this is mainly for me, but I find that writing things down is very important in the nature of learning.
I will be updating this on what portion of the code we are at!!!
In the dotted lines we have the first boilderplate introduction to sqlite, which is a representation of SQLite, a widely used database engine.
Database: A system that store data in an organized way! (Tables, rows and columns)
SQLite: A small, fast, self-contained SQL database engine that:
    1.Runs inside your app (no seperate server needed),
    2.Uses a single file to store the whole database
    3.Very portable
It's used pretty much everywhere, IOS,Firefox,Chrome.

As of below we have a car, you can turn it on and it will start, but there is no gas pedal, any type of fuctionality is missing as of now.
No commands work, you can only exit and start it.

```
int main()
```
